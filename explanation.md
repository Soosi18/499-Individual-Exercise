## File Details and Feature Explanation

1. MinMax.java - Generates an int array with 5 random values between 0 and 99. Contains the methods findMin() and findMax() that take an int array as input
and return the min and max elements in the array.

2. MinMaxTest.java - Contains unit tests for the findMin() and findMax() methods from file 1. For both functions, the Assert.assertEquals() method is called
to test if the actual output matches the expected output. A sample int array is entered as a parameter to get the actual output.

3. CheckRepeating.java - Generates a char array with 5 random values from a to z. Contains the method checkRepeatingLetter() that take in a char array as input,
sort it alphabetically with the help of the built-in Arrays.sort function, and then check if any letter repeats itself in the array by using a for-loop 
and comparing current-index value to the next index value.

4. CheckRepeatingTest.java - Contains unit tests for the checkRepeatingLetter() method from file 3. Again, the Assert.assertEquals() function is used to call
the checkRepeatingLetters() method using a sample char array, and checking the expected output against the actual output.
