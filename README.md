##### Feature 1 - Finding Min and Max values in a randomly generated int array

Running the file 'MinMax.java' generates an int array of 5 random numbers between 0 and 99. It then prints this randomly generated array to the console.
The methods findMin() and findMax() are used to find the smallest and largest values in this array, and the results are printed to the console. The file MinMaxTest.java
can be run to test and make sure these methods are working as intended.    

##### Feature 2 - Checking for repeating/duplicate letters in a char array
CheckRepeating.java declares and initializes a char array of size 5, with random letters from a-z. The contents of this random array are then printed
to console. The method checkRepeatingLetter() sorts this char array alphabetically and checks for duplicate letters by comparing the letter at each 
index to the next. If there is a repeating letter, it returns true, otherwise it returns false. The results of this check are then printed to console 
with the help of the conditional operator. CheckRepeatingTest.java contains tests to make sure this method is running correctly.
