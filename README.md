##### Feature 2 - Checking for repeating/duplicate letters in a char array
CheckRepeating.java declares and initializes a char array of size 5, with random letters from a-z. The contents of this random array are then printed
to console. The method checkRepeatingLetter() sorts this char array alphabetically and checks for duplicate letters by comparing the letter at each 
index to the next. If there is a repeating letter, it returns true, otherwise it returns false. The results of this check are then printed to console 
with the help of the conditional operator. CheckRepeatingTest.java contains tests to make sure this method is running correctly.
