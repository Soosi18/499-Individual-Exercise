##### Feature 1 - Finding Min and Max values in a randomly generated int array

Running the file 'MinMax.java' generates an int array of 5 random numbers between 0 and 99. It then prints this randomly generated array to the console.
The methods findMin() and findMax() are used to find the smallest and largest values in this array, and the results are printed to the console. The file MinMaxTest.java
can be run to test and make sure these methods are working as intended.
